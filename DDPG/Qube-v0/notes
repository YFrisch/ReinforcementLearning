- Parameters from BallBalancerSim-v0 do not work
- higher batch-size (1024) seems to be good
	- not sure about that
- low amount of random actions (e.g. epsilon 0.02) seems to help
	- not sure about that
- gets often stuck in local optimal
- "harder" updates seem to be crucial
	- tau = 1e-2 already works way better than tau = 1e-3
	- (first nice results after increasing tau)
