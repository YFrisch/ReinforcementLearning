# Reinforcement Learning
Repo for the RL course at TU Darmstadt.

### Algorithms
* [Natural Actor Critic](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/courses/amath579/reading/NaturalActorCritic.pdf "Link to the Paper") 
* [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)

### Platforms
* [Furuta Pendulum](https://www.quanser.com/products/rotary-inverted-pendulum/)
* Double Cart Pole
* [Ball Balancer](https://www.quanser.com/products/2-dof-ball-balancer/)

### Seminar Paper

- [ ] Furuta Pendulum Report
- [ ] Improvements for NAC (not yet specified)
- [ ] Extensions for DDPG and Analysis of it's Components

### Challenges

The Challenges are practical RL assignments during the semester. The environments use the [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) library by OpenAI and can be found in the following [GitLab Repository](https://git.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/quanser/clients) of [Quanser Robots](https://www.quanser.com/products/).

1. Dynamic Programming (using the [Pendulum](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/))
2. LSPI & DQN (using CartPole)
